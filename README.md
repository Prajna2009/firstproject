A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data. DBMS include change management, performance monitoring/tuning and backup and recovery. Many database management systems are also responsible for automated rollbacks, restarts and recovery as well as the logging and auditing of activity.
India has many commercial enterprise and Insurance Companies are on of them, and they would have a huge database to manage in order to maintain the details of Insurance Holders, Insurance Policies, Agents etc. which is indeed difficult to handle manually and we cannot expect accuracy through it. Hence we came up with an idea of developing a project which would help these companies to maintain their database. Our project provides the features to insert, update, delete and to view the policy details. We implemented this using Java and MYSQL where Swing(Java) was used to design graphical user interface and MYSQL as the backend.
